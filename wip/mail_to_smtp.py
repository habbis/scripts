#Use a messaging service that provides an email-to-SMS gateway: Many mobile carriers offer an email-to-SMS gateway that allows you to send SMS messages from your email client. To send an SMS message using this method, you can use Python's smtplib module to send an email to the carrier's email-to-SMS gateway address. The format of the gateway address varies by carrier, but it is typically in the form of number@carrier.com. For example, to send an SMS message to a Verizon phone, you can use the following code:






import smtplib

# Your email address and password
username = "you@example.com"
password = "your_password"

# The phone number you want to send the SMS to (must be in the form "number@carrier.com")
to_number = "1234567890@vtext.com"

# The message you want to send
message = "Hello, this is a test SMS message."

# Create an SMTP client and send the email
server = smtplib.SMTP("smtp.example.com")
server.login(username, password)
server.sendmail(username, to_number, message)
server.quit()
